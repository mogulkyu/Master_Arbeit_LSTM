  abstract      = {In the modern world, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has contributed to improvements in various areas, including automation, computer vision, fraud detection, and more. AI can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency of Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (ASTM) systems and reduce traffic congestion rates. This paper presents an Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (STM) system that uses AI to improve traffic flow rates. The system employs the YOLO V5 Convolutional Neural Network to detect vehicles in traffic management images. Additionally, it predicts the number of vehicles for the next 12 hours using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). The Smart Traffic Management Cycle Length Analysis manages the traffic cycle length based on these vehicle predictions, aided by AI. From the results of the RNN-LSTM model for predicting vehicle numbers over the next 12 hours, we observe that the model predicts traffic with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.521 vehicles and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.232 vehicles. After simulating the STM system in the CARLA simulation environment, we found that the Traffic Management Congestion Flow Rate with ASTM (21 vehicles per minute) is 50\% higher than the rate without STM (around 15 vehicles per minute). Additionally, the Traffic Management Vehicle Pass Delay with STM (5 seconds per vehicle) is 70\% lower than without STM (around 12 seconds per vehicle). These results demonstrate that the STM system using AI can increase traffic flow by 50\% and reduce vehicle pass delays by 70\%.},

  abstract      = {Deep learning (DL) methods have outperformed parametric models such as historical average, ARIMA and variants in predicting traffic variables into short and near-short future, that are critical for traffic management. Specifically, recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variants (e.g. long short-term memory) are designed to retain long-term temporal correlations and therefore are suitable for modeling sequences. However, multi-regime models assume the traffic system to evolve through multiple states (say, free-flow, congestion in traffic) with distinct characteristics, and hence, separate models are trained to characterize the traffic dynamics within each regime. For instance, Markov-switching models with a hidden Markov model (HMM) for regime identification is capable of capturing complex dynamic patterns and non-stationarity. Interestingly, both HMM and LSTM can be used for modeling an observation sequence from a set of latent or, hidden state variables. In LSTM, the latent variable is computed in a deterministic manner from the current observation and the previous latent variable, while, in HMM, the set of latent variables is a Markov chain. Inspired by research in natural language processing, a hybrid hidden Markov-LSTM model that is capable of learning complementary features in traffic data is proposed for traffic flow prediction. Results indicate significant performance gains in using hybrid architecture compared to conventional methods such as Markov switching ARIMA and LSTM.},
